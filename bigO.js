// 1. What is the Big O for this?
// 1a) O(1) - Regardless of how many dog owners there are in the room, we yell once to inquire and we get 1 reply
// 1b) O(n) - We have to ask each dog owner until we find a matching breed dog owner. Worst case is we have to ask every single dog owner.
// 2. Even or odd - O(1) Even or odd, 1 boolean value has to return.
// 3. Are you here? - O(n^2) Nested for loops, which means that the outer array will run thorugh the inner array for every element in the first array.
// 4. Doubler - O(n) Reads value of array only once each.
// 5. Naive Search - O(n) Reads once for each index in array to find the item
// 6. Creating pairs - O(n^2) Nested for loops, which means that the index of the outer loop will run through every index of the inner loop.
// 7. Compute the sequence - O()
// 8. An efficient search - O()
// 9. Random element - O()
// 10. What Am I? - O()
// 11. Tower of Hanoi - O()
// 12. Iterative version - O()
// 13. Recursive Big O - O()
